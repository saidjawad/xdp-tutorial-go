#+TITLE: XDP Tutorial in Go

This repository contains my attempt to use Golang for implementing the user 
space programs from the [[https://github.com/xdp-project/xdp-tutorial][XDP-tutorial]].

The plan is to follow the original structure and content. Hence, I will 
reuse their eBPF programs, and try to replicate the behavior of their user space
programs. Naturally, I will have to adapt some of their build instructions. 

* Setting up dependencies

If you follow the [[https://github.com/xdp-project/xdp-tutorial/blob/master/setup_dependencies.org][Setup Dependencies]] from their tutorial, 
you will ba able to build and run the code in this repository without any problems.
One notable difference is that we don't have any dependencies on *libxdp*. 

* Compiling the code

After setting up dependencies, you can  =make= command.
